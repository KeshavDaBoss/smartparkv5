## Overview

**SmartPark v5** is a comprehensive IoT-enabled parking management solution designed to optimize urban mobility. By integrating edge computing hardware (ESP32/Raspberry Pi) with a sophisticated web platform, the system delivers real-time occupancy monitoring, seamless capability for advance slot booking, and intelligent navigation assistance.

The platform features a **Dynamic Floor Plan** offering immediate visual feedback on slot availability, utilizing advanced pathfinding algorithms to guide users efficiently to their designated spots.

## System Architecture

The architecture of SmartPark v5 is designed for modularity, scalability, and real-time performance. It consists of three primary layers:

1.  **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**:
    -   Built with **React.js** and **Vite** for high-performance rendering.
    -   Visualizes the parking floor plan dynamically.
    -   Communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs to fetch slot status and manage bookings.

2.  **Logic & Data Layer (Backend)**:
    -   Powered by **FastAPI (Python)**, ensuring low-latency request handling.
    -   Manages the state of all parking slots, processing data from hardware sensors and user interactions.
    -   Implements complex logic for pathfinding (A* algorithm), conflict resolution for bookings, and user authentication.

3.  **Physical Layer (Hardware & Edge Computing)**:
    -   **Raspberry Pi 4**: Acts as the central gateway and controls local sensors for Mall 1. It hosts the backend server.
    -   **ESP32 Node**: A wireless sensor node for Mall 2 that transmits ultrasonic sensor data to the main server over WiFi. It also controls local LED indicators for booking visualization.

## Key Capabilities

- **Real-Time Occupancy Detection**: Precision monitoring using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors.
- **Advanced Booking Engine**:
  - Flexible scheduling for **Today** and **Tomorrow**.
  - Multi-slot reservation capability.
  - Automated conflict resolution logic.
- **Intelligent Navigation**:
  - **Interactive Floor Plan**: Dynamic visualization of slot states (Free, Occupied, Booked, My Booking).
  - **A* Pathfinding**: Optimal route calculation from entry to slot.
  - **Load Balancing**: Automated redirection to alternative levels when capacity is reached.
- **Accessibility Focus**:
  - Reserved zones for **Disabled** and **Elderly** users.
  - Profile-based access control ensuring restricted slots are only bookable by authorized users.
- **Hardware Feedback Loop**:
  - Physical LED indicators sync with digital booking state in real-time.
